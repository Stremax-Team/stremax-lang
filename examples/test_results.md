 # Stremax-Lang Test Results

This document contains the results of testing the Stremax-Lang examples.

## Test Results

| Example | Status | Result |
|---------|--------|--------|
| simple.sx | ✅ | Returns 15 |
| arithmetic.sx | ✅ | Returns 37 (last expression result) |
| strings.sx | ✅ | Returns "John Doe" |
| conditionals.sx | ✅ | Returns 50 |
| boolean.sx | ✅ | Returns 1 (true) |
| combined.sx | ✅ | Returns 100 |
| errors.sx | ✅ | Throws "Division by zero" error |
| scoping.sx | ✅ | Returns 30 |
| scoping_error.sx | ✅ | Returns 20 (variables accessible outside blocks) |
| debug.sx | ✅ | Returns 65 (only shows final result) |
| token.sx | ❌ | Parser errors |
| voting.sx | ❌ | Parser errors |
| auction.sx | ❌ | Parser errors |

## Observations

1. The interpreter correctly handles basic arithmetic operations, string concatenation, and conditional expressions.
2. Error handling works as expected, with appropriate error messages for runtime errors like division by zero.
3. Block scoping is not fully implemented - variables defined in blocks are accessible outside their blocks.
4. Only the last expression's result is returned, which is consistent with the interpreter's design.
5. The advanced examples (token.sx, voting.sx, auction.sx) fail with parser errors because the parser doesn't support contract syntax and blockchain-specific features yet.
6. The CLI is very simple and only supports running a file with the `run -file` command. There are no debug or verbose flags available.

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper block scoping to ensure variables are only accessible within their defined blocks.
2. Add support for boolean literals (true/false) instead of relying on integers.
3. Implement support for string and integer concatenation.
4. Add support for arrays and maps.
5. Implement function declarations and function calls.
6. Add support for contract syntax and blockchain-specific features.
7. Enhance the type system to support custom types and type annotations.
8. Add debugging and verbose output options to the CLI.
9. Implement a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for interactive development.
