# Stremax-Lang Test Results

This document contains the results of testing the Stremax-Lang examples.

## Test Results

| Example | Status | Result |
|---------|--------|--------|
| simple.sx | ✅ | Returns 15 |
| arithmetic.sx | ✅ | Returns 37 (last expression result) |
| strings.sx | ✅ | Returns "John Doe" |
| conditionals.sx | ✅ | Returns 50 |
| boolean.sx | ✅ | Returns 1 (true) |
| logical.sx | ✅ | Returns true (last expression result) |
| simple_logical.sx | ✅ | Returns false (a && b where a=true, b=false) |
| combined.sx | ✅ | Returns 100 |
| errors.sx | ✅ | Throws "Division by zero" error |
| scoping.sx | ✅ | Returns 30 |
| scoping_error.sx | ✅ | Throws "Identifier not found" error |
| debug.sx | ✅ | Returns 65 (only shows final result) |
| token.sx | ❌ | Parser errors |
| voting.sx | ❌ | Parser errors |
| auction.sx | ❌ | Parser errors |

## Observations

1. The interpreter correctly handles basic arithmetic operations, string concatenation, and conditional expressions.
2. Error handling works as expected, with appropriate error messages for runtime errors like division by zero.
3. Block scoping is now properly implemented - variables defined in blocks are not accessible outside their blocks.
4. Boolean literals (true/false) are now directly supported.
5. Logical operators (&&, ||) with short-circuit evaluation are now supported.
6. Only the last expression's result is returned, which is consistent with the interpreter's design.
7. The advanced examples (token.sx, voting.sx, auction.sx) fail with parser errors because the parser doesn't support contract syntax and blockchain-specific features yet.
8. The CLI is very simple and only supports running a file with the `run -file` command. There are no debug or verbose flags available.

## Next Steps

1. Implement support for string and integer concatenation.
2. Add support for arrays and maps.
3. Implement function declarations and function calls.
4. Add support for contract syntax and blockchain-specific features.
5. Enhance the type system to support custom types and type annotations.
6. Add debugging and verbose output options to the CLI.
7. Implement a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for interactive development.
